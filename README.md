# NFL-Fantasy-API
For anyone who wishes to optimize their fantasy sports experience.

  This project is designed to reduce the time it takes to manage fantasy rosters between adding and dropping players on waivers, setting your lineup, and various other tedious
tasks required to win your fantasy league. The project in its current state is only meant to be used in conjunction with yahoo fantasy football, and the rankings are generated
from thescore.com. The rankings origin can be changed very easily as the specific web pages are generated from a config file, however some of the code may need to be tweaked.

  To use this API, it is intended to be run and utilized with the user inputting commands in the command prompt.
